- ## Launching VPC Resources

  In this project, I focused on establishing a secure and efficient network infrastructure using Amazon Web Services (AWS). The key tasks included:

  - **Create Private/Public Subnets** 🚷: Set up both private and public subnets to segregate resources based on their accessibility requirements.
  - **Configure Private/Public Route Tables** 🚧: Managed traffic routing within the respective subnets by configuring route tables.
  - **Implement Private/Public Network ACLs** 🚔: Enhanced security by controlling inbound and outbound traffic through Network Access Control Lists (ACLs).
  - **Launch EC2 Instances in Public Subnet** 💻: Deployed EC2 instances in the public subnet to facilitate internet communication.
  - **Launch EC2 Instances in Private Subnet** 🤐: Deployed EC2 instances in the private subnet to ensure secure and isolated operations.
  - **Utilize AWS VPC Wizard** ⚡️: Leveraged the AWS VPC wizard for rapid and efficient VPC creation.

  This project reinforced my understanding of AWS networking services and highlighted the importance of meticulous planning and execution in creating a secure and efficient network environment.

- ## VPC - Traffic Flow and Security
  In this project, I focused on designing and securing a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on AWS. The key tasks accomplished include:
  
  - **Created an Amazon VPC** ☁️: Established a custom VPC to isolate and manage resources securely.
  - **Created a Public Subnet** 🥅: Configured a public subnet to host resources that need internet access.
  - **Set Up an Internet Gateway** 🚪: Implemented an internet gateway to enable communication between the VPC and the internet.
  - **Created a Route Table** 🛣️: Defined routes to direct traffic within the VPC and to external networks.
  - **Created a Security Group** 🔒: Established a security group to control inbound and outbound traffic to resources within the VPC.
  - **Created a Network ACL** 🛡️: Configured a Network Access Control List (ACL) to provide an additional layer of security at the subnet level.
  
  This project demonstrates my ability to design, configure, and secure a VPC, showcasing skills in network architecture, traffic management, and security 
  implementation.

- ## Cloud Security with AWS IAM
  In this project, I focused on enhancing cloud infrastructure management and security using AWS services. The key tasks accomplished include:

  - **Created and Managed EC2 Instances** 🖥️: Provisioned and maintained multiple EC2 instances to support various applications and workloads.
  - **Developed and Applied IAM Policies** 🔒: Designed and implemented IAM policies to ensure secure and controlled access to AWS resources.
  - **Set Up IAM Users and User Groups** 👥: Configured IAM users and groups to manage permissions and streamline user access management.
  - **Configured an AWS Account Alias** 🏷️: Customized the AWS account alias for easier identification and management of the account.
    
  This project demonstrates my ability to effectively utilize AWS services to build and manage secure, scalable cloud environments.

- ## Host a Website on Amazon S3
  In this project, I focused on hosting a static website on Amazon S3. The key tasks accomplished include:
  
  - **Created and Configured an Amazon S3 Bucket** 🪣: Set up an S3 bucket, fine-tuned access control lists (ACLs), enabled versioning, and ensured public access.
  - **Uploaded Website Content** 🌐: Delved into the intricacies of static websites and successfully hosted them on S3.
  - **Resolved Public Access Challenges** 🔓: Overcame an intriguing issue related to website visibility, ensuring the site is accessible to the public.
    
  This project showcases my ability to leverage AWS S3 for hosting static websites, demonstrating skills in configuration, content management, and troubleshooting access issues.

- ## Visualize Data with QuickSight
  In this project, I focused on visualizing data using Amazon QuickSight. The key tasks accomplished include:

  - **Created an S3 Bucket and upload a Dataset into it** 🪣: Created an S3 Bucket and uploaded the dataset to an Amazon S3 bucket for storage and accessibility.
  - **Create an Account on Amazon QuickSight** 🆕: Set up a new account on Amazon QuickSight to leverage its data visualization capabilities.
  - **Connect Your Dataset to Amazon QuickSight** 🔗: Linked the dataset stored in the S3 bucket to Amazon QuickSight for analysis.
  - **Create a Variety of Graphs, Charts, and Analysis** 📊: Utilized QuickSight to generate various graphs, charts, and perform in-depth data analysis.
  - **Publish a Dashboard Full of Insights** 🏆: Published a comprehensive dashboard showcasing valuable insights derived from the dataset.
  
  This project highlights my proficiency in using Amazon QuickSight for data visualization, demonstrating skills in data integration, analysis, and dashboard creation.
